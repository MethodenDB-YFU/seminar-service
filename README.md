# Seminar Service

Spring Based Service providing a RESTful API for all YFU seminars. This **does not** include the actual event but only the abstract concept of a seminar. A tooling will provide management to add, delete and update seminar types, assign goals to them and more. Parts of this tooling will be included in the upcoming MethodenDB frontend.
